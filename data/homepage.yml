    <p class="lead">
    <strong> I aim to synthesize my knowledge of the biomedical sciences, clinical research, and data science to become a physician-scientist capable of seamlessly integrating clinical care with clinical research in a way that maximizes evidence-based care options for my patients. </strong> 
    </p>
    <pre>
    
    In the world of medicine, <br> 
    There is a need for precision, <br> 
    Clinical research is the foundation, <br> 
    Data science adds a new dimension. <br>
    
    Patient care is always the goal, <br> 
    Research helps us reach that role, <br> 
    But data science is a key part, <br> 
    To help us make discoveries that are smart. <br>
    
    Clinical trials and experiments, <br>
    Are critical for treatments, <br>
    But without data, they are incomplete, <br>
    And the results may not be concrete. <br>

    Data science adds depth and breadth, <br>
    To the research that we have left, <br>
    New insights and discoveries to be found, <br>
    As we dive deep into the data, unbound. <br>

    From genomic sequencing to drug development, <br>
    Data science has the potential to cement, <br>
    The discoveries that will change the game, <br> 
    And help us advance medicine, it's not just a game. <br>

    So let's work together, hand in hand, <br>
    With clinical research and data science in command, <br>
    To make strides in the world of medicine, <br>
    And help all of humanity to win. <br>
